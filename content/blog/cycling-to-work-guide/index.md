Thanks to COVID-19, cycling to work has become a hot topic, and more cities are deploying
their cycling infrastructure to keep everybody safe. But for me, after three years
cycling to work has become an integral part of my daily routine. I am much fitter,
I've energy to spare and I've also rediscovered one of my hobbies.

The current lockdown is the perfect opportunity to take a look back and to put my learnings
in writing. This post contains all I wish I had known when I started, and I hope you find
it useful.

## Why cycle to work?

According to my experience, there are three reasons:
- cycling to work is **a great time saver**, especially if the morning traffic is slow in 
your area. To help you put things in perspective, cycling to work saves me 45 minutes a day on average.
And since you are doing cardio as you cycle, you will spend less time at the gym.
- you **won't need to rely on schedules to commute**. Leaving home at the right time to avoid
a traffic jam, missing the last train or waiting for 15 minutes at a bus stop will become 
a thing of the past.
- **it's dirt cheap**. To give you an example, after I stopped using the public transport my
simple, brand new bicycle paid for itself in three months. Had I been driving to work, this
would have happened even earlier.

## What are the first steps?

### Learn if you are eligible for a cycle-to-work scheme

In [Ireland](http://www.cyclingireland.ie/page/disciplines/advocacy/bike-to-work-scheme) and the 
[UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-to-work-scheme-implementation-guidance) , 
you can spend up to 1000 euro/pounds on a new bicycle, clothing and accessories _tax free_. 
If you are planning to buy a new bicycle, ask your employer to find out if you are eligible.

### Get yourself a bycicle

If you have the option, **consider using a bike sharing service first**.
The initial investment is next to nothing, and you won't have to worry about the maintenance.

If **you already have a bike**, **have it serviced before hitting the roads**. Most mechanics will
charge you between 50 and 60 Euro, and you will know that all the parts in your bike are 
properly tightened and that your gears -and most importantly- your brakes and tyres are in good,
working condition.

If **you are buying a bike**, **get a simple one**. You will only need a decent range of gears 
(at least 7 in the back), sturdy rim brakes and no suspension. If **you go second hand**, 
**find a friend or a trusted mechanic** to help you check the bike. Most second hand bikes
on the ad sites have issues, and sometimes the repairs can be more expensive than the bike itself.

### Buy a helmet

As a rule of thumb, **don't ever ride a bike without a helmet**. If you are unlucky and have a crash, 
your head will likely hit the tarmac. A helmet will save you from needing stitches or getting a severe concussion. Invest between 50 and 100 Euro in a good quality helmet: it pays off.

You **wont't need any special clothes** to start cycling. Make sure that you are wearing something
comfortable, and if you'd like to invest in a cycling kit make sure you buy a good pair of cycling
shorts and a windproof jacket, in that order.

### Get yourself insured

Most people wouldn't drive a car without insurance, but it still shocks me how many uninsured 
cyclists can be found out in the wild. 

Cycling insurance is _very cheap_ (i.e. an [annual Cycling Ireland membership](http://www.cyclingireland.ie/page/membership) is 50 euro), and will cover any property damage or medical expenses that you may
have as a result of an accident. You can spend a bit more and get a policy that covers accidental
damage to your bike and theft too (i.e. [Bikmo](https://bikmo.com/)).

### Get the essential accessories (only if you ride your own bike)

In general, keeping thieves away from your bike is a good idea. You should be able to find **a good quality
D-lock** (like the [Kryptonite Evolution](https://amzn.to/3g1oeGz)) in the 50 to 60 Euro range.

Second, you will have to pump air into the tyres regularly. Getting the 
pressure up to the recommended value takes _a lot_ of effort, and that's where a **floor pump** comes in handy. I'm very happy with [my Topeak pump](https://amzn.to/3cG9daT), but if you are looking for
something compact that you can take on your commute [this pump](https://amzn.to/3dR4xiv) has been a lifesaver for my cycling mates and me.

Third, your chain needs lubrication, especially in wetter climates. 
A [tin of cleaning spray](https://amzn.to/3dP5vfg) and some [wet lube](https://amzn.to/2zNAObq) will
last _ages_ and will keep your bike riding nicely.

Last, but not least, you will need a [light set](https://amzn.to/3dXBNF7) to stay visible on the road in 
the darker evenings, a [multitool](https://amzn.to/3cEXZDs) to tighten the bolts on your bike and finally
[two tyre levers](https://amzn.to/3fUoAhP) and a spare tube to fix a puncture that you will
inevitably get.

## How can I start cycling to work?

### Your first two weeks

The first weeks are always challenging. Here are five tips that should point you in the right direction:

- **plan your route ahead of time and give it a go on a weekend**. The roads will be quieter, and you'll be able to take as much time as you need.  Don't be let down if you are slow or feel tired, 
we've all been there.
- **keep the same pace**. Since you won't be racing anyone, you should choose a pace you are comfortable
with. If you are going uphill, start at around 60% of your maximum effort and keep it steady until you
get to the summit. Be patient: you will increase your speed over time.
- **in the early days, only cycle for half of your commute**. If your workplace has a safe room where
you can lock your bike, you can leave it overnight and take the public transport or get a lift home.
Keep up building your strength over the first two weeks by increasing the distance gradually.
- **go slower on your way to work, and change clothes if you need to**. When you do exercise you will
inevitably sweat, but you can avoid most of it by going slower on your way to work. I'd also recommend
you to change clothes on rainy days or simply if you don't want to get marks from the saddle in 
your favourite trousers.
- **track your efforts** and see how your average speed and time improve week after week.
There are many free apps out there, but [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) is probably the best.

### How to be safer on the roads

At some stage of your commute, you will be sharing the road with other drivers. And you will
definitely share the space with cyclists and pedestrians, which can be _worse_ than 
the drivers sometimes.

There is one simple rule that will keep you safe:
> assume that everybody else on the road is a moron and expect anything from them

It's amazing how many good tips can be derived from this rule:
- **don't cycle on the side of the road** as some drivers will be tempted to overtake you badly.
Take your space instead.
- **don't stay too close to a car/cyclist in front of you**: they can stop suddenly.
- **always look twice** before making any turn or switching lanes.
- **in junctions, make visual contact** with drivers and other cyclists to make sure they can see you.
- **don't wear headphones**: you won't hear the threats coming at you.
- **watch out for pedestrians**: they will usually cross the road as they please.

However, the rule above also has a counterpart:
> don't be a moron yourself

Among other things, you must:
- **signal all your turns**, even if you can't see anyone behind you. 
- **stop at red lights and junctions** to keep everyone safe.
- **be kind to drivers and other cyclists**, especially to learners.
- **cycle only on roads and designated lanes**. Sidewalks are _not_ bike lanes, and you can only 
_walk_ on them.
- **keep your lights on when it's dark**.


## What should I know about bike maintenance?

### Don't neglect the basics

If you spend some time maintaining your bike, it will ride nicely and its parts will last for
much longer. Here is what you need to know:

- **clean and lubricate your chain and clean the sprockets** every two weeks on dry weather, 
or weekly on wet weather. _Don't_ put WD-40 in your chain: it's a degreaser, and it will remove the oil instead.
- **check the pressure of your tyres weekly**. If you cycle with underinflated tyres, you can get
a puncture easily and damage the tyres, the rims or both.
- **dry your frame and handlebars if you have been cycling in the rain**.
- **take care of your brakes**. Keep the braking surfaces (i.e. rims, discs) clean, and tighten
your brakes montly.
- **clean up your bike once a month**. A cloth, a bucket of soapy water and a bucket of clean water will 
do the trick. _Don't_ be tempted to powerwash your bike as you can strip the grease that protects the bearings.

### Let your local mechanic help you

You should **have your bike serviced regularly**. If you only do the basic
maintenance, you should visit your local bike shop every four months. If you like fixing your bike 
yourself, have it checked at least twice a year.

Your local mechanic will replace worn parts before they create a problem, and will also teach 
you some awesome tricks!

### A rough maintenance schedule for a commuter bike

The table below contains the most common maintenance tasks, including how often they should be performed and a cost estimate for the parts. I hope this helps you on your next visit to your bike shop.

| Task     | Approximate frequency | Cost of the parts (in Euro) |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Regular service | Once/three times a year | Between 50 and 60 for labour |
| Replace the tubes | Once a year | Between 5 and 10 |
| Replace the chain | Once a year | Between 20 and 30 |
| Replace brake pads | Once a year | Less than 20 |
| Change pedals | Every 2 years | Between 20 and 30 |
| Change brake or gear cables | Every 2 years | Less than 15 |
| Change cassette or freewheel | Every 2 years | Between 20 and 40 |
| Change tyres | Every 2 years | Between 20 and 40 each |
| Change chainrings or chainset | Every 3 years | Between 20 and 40 |
| Replace bottom bracket | Every 3 years | Between 10 and 20 |
| Change wheels | Every 4 years | Between 80 and 150 (whole set) |
| Change brakes | Every 4 years | Between 20 and 40  |

## Closing thoughts

Some of the topics mentioned on this page (i.e. buying a second-hand bike)
would deserve several posts, but I think this should be enough for now.
